<h3>Origins</h3>
<hr/>
<p>In May 1998, Volkswagen AG acquired the rights to use the Bugatti logo and the trade name Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. 
    To succeed the EB 110 model produced under the previous ownership, the automaker quickly released a 
    series of concept cars whose technological advancements would culminate in the form of the Veyron 16.4.</p>

<p>Between October 1998 and September 1999, Bugatti introduced a series of Giugiaro-designed concept vehicles, each with permanent four-wheel drive and powered by the Volkswagen-designed W18 engine. The first car, the EB 118, was a 2-door luxury coup√© presented at the 1998 Paris Motor Show. The next car, the EB 218, was a 4-door saloon presented at the 1999 Geneva Motor Show. The third and final car, the 18/3 Chiron, 
    was a mid-engine sports car presented at the 1999 International Motor Show in Frankfurt.[13]</p>
